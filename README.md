COMP 490 Project 1

Need to install requests, pyside6, and create a file called secrets.py that 
contains api_key

This project grabs data from a specified API in json format and saves it to database. 

The database has one table with 12 columns: 
entryNum, prefix, fName, lName, title, orgName, email, ,orgSite, phoneNum, opportunities, collabTime, permission

Entries are displayed in buttons on the side. Clicking one will show the full information of the entry.

Nothing is missing from this project
